# Release Readiness: v0.21.37

**Release Date:** 2026-10-27<br>
**Released By:** gaebal-gajae (autonomous release)<br>
**Baseline:** v0.21.36 (npm latest 0.21.36; tag commit `fe09b80e76e85105c10840730bdca5397247a9e4`)<br>
**Range:** [`v0.21.36...v0.21.37`](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/compare/v0.21.36...v0.21.37)

## Summary

**Patch release:** npm global-install ownership detection now handles a custom global prefix, and plugin-cache diagnostics distinguish malformed completion markers from marker-version and claim-digest mismatches.

- **Fix:** Recognize npm-managed global installs when npm's global prefix differs from the active Node runtime path, while keeping ownership validation fail-closed (#3922; fixes #3920).
- **Fix:** Report malformed plugin-cache completion markers, marker-version mismatches, and claim-digest mismatches separately in setup/doctor; provenance semantics are unchanged (#3923; fixes #3921).
- **Dependencies:** @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.32.1 → 1.32.2 (runtime, #3917); @biomejs/biome 2.5.15 → 2.6.2 (development only, #3916).
- **Breaking changes:** None.

## Compare-range inventory

Previous released tag `v0.21.36` is an ancestor of pinned dev candidate `18963b5604aa296d4fe8a019651d0ddef9584106`. `origin/main` (`6b1c110ec06b45a5644ceb6ee60788f7ccae6c46`) is already an ancestor of the candidate, so merging it into the release branch was a no-op.

At the pinned source candidate, `git diff --stat v0.21.36..18963b5604aa296d4fe8a019651d0ddef9584106` reports **11 files changed, 423 insertions(+), 58 deletions(-)**. The diff includes the new behavior/tests, dependency lock updates, 0.21.37 metadata, and an update to the previous release's readiness evidence. This is the pinned source-range stat; release collateral on the release branch is tracked separately in the final PR evidence below.

The initial release-collateral branch head contained 12 commits in `v0.21.36..HEAD`; `git diff --stat v0.21.36..HEAD` reported **15 files changed, 621 insertions(+), 73 deletions(-)**, including the four release-collateral files. Release PR and later readiness evidence are recorded separately below and will be included in the final PR-head range stat.

## Not included / known gaps

- #3924 (fix for #3918) remains in its separate review and is not included in this release; it is planned for a later release. It was not pulled into the release branch.
- #3898 (live-pin fix) remains blocked on an owner design decision; #3900 and #3907 are open drafts. On Codex 0.164.0, `.omx-live-pin` files in the plugin cache can invalidate hook approval. The workaround posted in #3898 disables the `oh-my-codex-local` plugin.

## Version synchronization

All coupled version surfaces already read `0.21.37`; no version bump was added during release preparation.

| Surface | Value |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | 0.21.37 |
| `package-lock.json` root package and package entry | 0.21.37 |
| `Cargo.toml` workspace package | 0.21.37 |
| `Cargo.lock` OMX workspace packages | 0.21.37 |
| `plugins/oh-my-codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | 0.21.37 |
| `src/cli/__tests__/version-sync-contract.test.ts` | verifies package/plugin/Cargo workspace alignment |

No stale `0.21.36` values remain in package, Cargo, plugin metadata, source version constants, or tests; references in historical release records and this release's baseline/compare range are intentional.

## Local gates

All local gates below passed on the release branch at source candidate `18963b5604aa296d4fe8a019651d0ddef9584106`:

- ✓ `npm ci` (172 packages; the `prepare` script's build completed).
- ✓ `npm run build`.
- ✓ `npm run check:no-unused`.
- ✓ `npm run lint` (890 files, no violations; Biome printed a deprecation warning for the existing `linter.recommended` config field).
- ✓ `cargo check --workspace --locked`.
- ✓ `npm run build:runtime`.
- ✓ `npm run verify:plugin-bundle` (24 canonical skill directories and plugin metadata).
- ✓ Focused compiled tests: `update.test.js`, `plugin-cache-symlink-provenance-3552.test.js`, `doctor-warning-copy.test.js`, `version-sync-contract.test.js`, and `generate-release-body.test.js` via `node dist/scripts/run-test-files.js`; all test files exited successfully.
- ✓ After the first release-PR CI run failed one pre-existing real-tmux assertion, the entire `launch-fallback.test.js` file passed locally (39 tests, 0 failures), including the specific detached-HUD restoration test.
- ✓ `git diff --check`.
- Final release-body generation will be recorded before tag push. The generator needs a resolvable `v0.21.37` ref; the direct pre-tag attempt before that ref exists correctly refused to render.

## CI gates

Pinned dev candidate: `18963b5604aa296d4fe8a019651d0ddef9584106`.

- Dev push CI run [40535642484](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40535642484) completed successfully. Latest-per-name check runs: **17 success, 8 skipped, 0 failures**.
- macOS Ralplan preflight security passed on Node 20 (job [122300847593](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40535642484/job/122300847593)) and Node 26.5.1 (job [122300847597](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40535642484/job/122300847597)).
- CI Status check passed (job [122309452327](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40535642484/job/122309452327)).
- Latest-per-name totals were computed from the commit checks endpoint by grouping check runs by name and selecting the greatest check-run ID; no failures or pending checks remained.

## Release PR, merge, and publication

- Release PR [#3925](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/3925), initial head `9d95e0789ff62b82e19c0b7256975decc4adb609`.
- Initial PR CI run [40542865035](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40542865035) had 25 success, 1 skipped, and 1 failure. The sole failed job was `Test (Node 20 / cli-core-rest)` (job [122325983906](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40542865035/job/122325983906)); one unrelated existing tmux test in `launch-fallback.test.js` observed HUD height 7 instead of the expected 2. That test file is unchanged by this release diff; the pinned dev candidate's CI was green, and the same full file passed locally after the failure. The failed PR run is not treated as green; a new exact-head CI result is required before merge.
- Updated PR head `e85819af5fa8287099b3d7082a06f42e111a90e4` passed CI run [40548292792](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40548292792): latest-per-name checks were **27 success, 1 skipped, 0 failures**; CI Status passed (job [122354854036](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40548292792/job/122354854036)). Both release-PR macOS Ralplan preflights passed: Node 20 (job [122344891580](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40548292792/job/122344891580)) and Node 26.5.1 (job [122344891673](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/actions/runs/40548292792/job/122344891673)).
- Codex code review completed on exact PR head `e85819af5fa8287099b3d7082a06f42e111a90e4` with no findings. The required inline-thread gate on this head printed `[]`; it must be run again immediately before merge on the final head.
- A subsequent readiness-only evidence update will trigger a fresh CI/review cycle; merge remains blocked until those checks are green and the final exact-head gate prints `[]`.
- Main merge commit and latest-per-name CI: pending.
- Annotated tag and tag-triggered Release workflow/assets: pending.
- npm publication/readback and non-draft GitHub Release verification: pending.

## Back-merge and cleanup

- Back-merge PR from `main` to `dev` using a merge commit: pending.
- Back-merge CI and inline-thread gate: pending.
- Release branch cleanup: pending.
