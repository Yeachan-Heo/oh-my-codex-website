# oh-my-codex 0.21.6

`0.21.6` is a maintenance and reliability release for the frozen range `v0.21.5..dev` (52 commits, 101 files, +4294/−707): tmux HUD lifecycle correctness, AGENTS scope fixes, credential/auth record hardening, Team dispatch and Windows startup robustness, a reusable default-model cost/quality evaluation suite, and dependency updates.

## Highlights

- **Reusable default-model cost/quality evaluations (#3663, #3665, #3666, #3667):** a declarative suite for OMX's default model lineup with deterministic stage-transition records, supplied-record reporting, and explicitly documented declaration/validation limits. This answers the evaluation request in issue #3655 without claiming unmeasured numbers.
- **tmux HUD lifecycle is now self-terminating and leak-free (#3660, #3683, #3685):** the HUD skips stale Team leader panes during reconciliation, no longer leaves orphan watchers or noisy reconcile failures behind, and closes itself when its tmux leader pane exits. Leader absence is decided from a validated server-wide pane snapshot, so a window move is never mistaken for an exit and a failed tmux query is never treated as evidence.
- **AGENTS scope correctness (#3678, #3684):** durable AGENTS content is no longer duplicated into session instructions, and global AGENTS survive project-scoped launches instead of being dropped.

## Fixes and compatibility

- Auth/credential handling: hardened auth storage, TOML boundaries, PATH resolution, and stderr redaction (#3662); oversized stderr suppression no longer swallows the next record (#3676).
- Team runtime: Windows `EPERM` fsync during startup is survivable (#3661), and non-directory entries no longer break Team dispatch draining (#3680).
- Notifications strip complete ANSI CSI sequences instead of leaving partial escapes in output (#3668).
- Ordinary requests stay out of optional workflow machinery (#3648); confirmed unused internal exports were removed rather than aliased (#3649).
- Documentation closes the remaining 0.21 capability-parity gaps (#3634).
- Dependency updates: `zod` 4.6.2, `@biomejs/biome` 2.5.13, `@types/node` 26.5.1 (#3673, #3674, #3675).
